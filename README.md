Project definition
Background
Analyzing Functional Connectivity by Region of Interest (ROI) to explore the connections between specific regions in the brain using the HCP resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data in relationship to cognition. This project involves selecting predefined functional regions as ROIs, and then measuring the signal fluctuations over time between these regions. This includes selection of the desired ROI’s, assigning of signals from the timeseries, preprocessing and a correlation analysis. The statistical analysis and interpretation will be in relation to cognition.

Tools
The "project template" project will rely on the following technologies:
Software: Jupyter, Python, R, GitHub.
Libraries: Nilearn, Scikit-learn.
Data Analysis Tools: Human Connectome Workbench, FreeSurfer, mriqc, xcp-d,qsiprep


Markdown, to structure the text.
The Hugo website framework which is used by the BHS website. This makes it possible to easily add the markdown project description to the website.
Adding the project to the website relies on github, through pull requests.
Dataset
The Human Connectome Project (HCP), aimed at mapping the neural connections in the human brain. Includes examining neural network pathways and circuits and their connection to cognitive functions, behaviours, and neurological disorders. The HCP incorporates advanced neuroimaging techniques like diffusion MRI (dMRI), resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), and task-based functional MRI (task-fMRI) to capture in-depth images of the brain's anatomy and activity. Data is collected from a broad group of healthy adult participants, including twins and siblings, to encapsulate the variability and complexity of the brain's connectivity patterns. The project combines data from multiple imaging methods for a more comprehensive understanding of brain connectivity, encompassing structural, functional, and behavioural data. The HCP also features longitudinal studies that monitor changes in brain connectivity over time in the same individuals. In this study, we will be focusing on the HCP Adult data set, specifically looking at resting state fMRI. By analyzing static connectivity by our region of interest, we can glean valuable insights into the brain's intrinsic functional architecture and how it may vary between individuals or change over time.

Deliverables
At the end of this project, we will have:

Write a script in Jupyter
Use python to run analysis 
Create a Git Repository 

Results
Progress overview
The project was swiftly initiated by P Bellec, based on the existing template created in 2019 by Tristan Glatard and improved by different students. It was really not that hard. Community feedback is expected to lead to rapid further improvements of this first version.

Tools I learned during this project
Meta-project P Bellec learned how to do a meta project for the first time, which is developping a framework while using it at the same time. It felt really weird, but somehow quite fun as well.
Github workflow- The successful use of this template approach will demonstrate that it is possible to incorporate dozens of students presentation on a website collaboratively over a few weeks.
Project content Through the project reports generated using the template, it is possible to learn about what exactly the brainhack school students are working on.
Results
Deliverable 1: report template
You are currently reading the report template! I will let you judge whether it is useful or not. If you think there is something that could be improved, please do not hesitate to open an issue here and let us know.

Deliverable 2: project gallery
You can check out the 2020 BrainHack School project gallery

ECG pupilometry pipeline by Marce Kauffmann
The repository of this project can be found here. The objective was to create a processing pipeline for ECG and pupillometry data. The motivation behind this task is that Marcel's lab (MIST Lab @ Polytechnique Montreal) was conducting a Human-Robot-Interaction user study. The repo features:

a video introduction to the project.
a presentation made in a jupyter notebook on the results of the project.
Notebooks for all analyses.
Detailed requirements files, making it easy for others to replicate the environment of the notebook.
An overview of the results in the markdown document.
Other projects
Here are other good examples of repositories:

Learning to manipulate biosignals with python by François Lespinasse
Run multivariate anaylysis to relate behavioral and electropyhysiological data
PET pipeline automation and structural MRI exploration by Rebekah Wickens
Working with PSG [EEG] data from Parkinson's patients by Cryomatrix

Deliverable 3: Instructions
To be made available soon.

Conclusion and acknowledgement
The BHS team hope you will find this template helpful in documenting your project. Developping this template was a group effort, and benefitted from the feedback and ideas of all BHS students over the years.
