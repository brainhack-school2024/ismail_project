## Project definition

### Background

Analyzing Functional Connectivity by Region of Interest (ROI) to explore the connections between specific regions in the brain using the HCP resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data in relationship to cognition. This project involves selecting predefined functional regions as ROIs, and then measuring the signal fluctuations over time between these regions. This includes selection of the desired ROIâ€™s, assigning of signals from the timeseries, preprocessing and a correlation analysis. The statistical analysis and interpretation will be in relation to cognition.

### Tools

The project will rely on the following technologies:
- Software: Jupyter, Python, R, GitHub.
- Libraries: Nilearn, Scikit-learn.
- Data Analysis Tools: Human Connectome Workbench, FreeSurfer, mriqc, xcp-d, qsiprep.

### Dataset

The Human Connectome Project (HCP) aims at mapping the neural connections in the human brain, including examining neural network pathways and circuits and their connection to cognitive functions, behaviours, and neurological disorders. The HCP Adult dataset includes data from multiple imaging methods such as diffusion MRI (dMRI), resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), and task-based functional MRI (task-fMRI), providing comprehensive insights into brain connectivity and variability.

### Deliverables

At the end of this project, we will have:
- Jupyter script for analysis.
- Python code for running analysis.
- Git repository for version control.
